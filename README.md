# 🤖 AI Engineer Roadmap 2026: Zero to Hero

> "The best way to predict the future is to build it." — A comprehensive, tracking-enabled roadmap for mastering AI Engineering in the 2026 landscape.

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains a structured, phase-by-phase roadmap designed to take a complete beginner to an advanced AI Engineer. Unlike generic roadmaps, this is specifically optimized for the **2026 market**, focusing on **Agentic AI**, **RAG systems**, and **Production-grade LLMOps**.

## 🚀 The Vision
My goal is to transition from zero knowledge to a "Hero" level AI Architect. This roadmap serves as my master plan, covering:
- **Skeleton:** Advanced Python & Data Logic
- **Brain:** Intuitive AI Mathematics (Linear Algebra & Probability)
- **Muscle:** Core Machine Learning & Deep Learning from scratch
- **Advanced:** Autonomous Agents, RAG, and Deployment

## 🛠️ The Tech Stack
- **Languages:** Python 3.12+ (Asyncio, OOP)
- **Mathematics:** Linear Algebra, Statistics, Calculus
- **AI Frameworks:** LlamaIndex, LangChain, CrewAI, PyTorch
- **Data:** Pandas, NumPy, Vector Databases (Pinecone/Weaviate)
- **Deployment:** Docker, FastAPI, AWS Bedrock

## 📂 Project Structure
- `roadmap.html`: A custom-built, interactive tracking website.
- `README.md`: Project documentation and philosophy.

## 📈 Learning Strategy (The 1-to-1 Rule)
I follow a strict discipline to ensure deep understanding:
- **20% Theory:** High-quality conceptual learning.
- **80% Building:** For every 1 hour of video, I spend 1 hour coding from scratch.
- **Persistence:** All progress is tracked locally via the included web dashboard.

## 🗺️ The Roadmap Phases

### Phase 1: The Skeleton (Programming & Logic)
- **Mastering Python:** OOP and modular system design.
- **Data manipulation:** Mastering the flow of information.

### Phase 2: The Brain (Intuitive Mathematics)
- **Linear Algebra:** Understanding the "Geometry" of data.
- **Probability:** Managing model confidence and distributions.

### Phase 3: The Muscle (Core Machine Learning)
- Building Neural Networks and Transformers from the ground up to understand the "Why" behind the "How."

### Phase 4: 2026 Specialization (Generative AI & Agents)
- Building autonomous agentic teams and production-ready AI systems.
